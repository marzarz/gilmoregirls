<h1> Season 1 </h1>

Rory has a difficult time settling in at Chilton, struggling to match the demands of private school and attracting the fury of
classmate Paris Geller. She meets her first boyfriend, Dean, but the pair break up when Rory doesn't reciprocate his "I love you".
She is also pursued by arrogant Chilton student Tristan, but she has little interest. Lorelai begins dating Rory's English teacher,
Max Medina, though their relationship is complicated by the situation. At the same time, she has a close friendship with the local
diner owner, Luke Danes, and several people comment on their mutual attraction - but Lorelai is in denial and Luke doesn't act on it.
Rory's father, Christopher Hayden, returns and also wants Lorelai but she tells him he is too immature for a family. All the while,
Lorelai struggles to adjust to having her parents in her life on a regular basis. Emily and Richard enjoy developing a relationship 
with their granddaughter, but also realise how much they have missed. The season ends with Rory reuniting with Dean and Max proposing
to Lorelai.
