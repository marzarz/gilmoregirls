Rory's attraction to Jess grows stronger, and she gets jealous when he teases her with a new girlfriend. Dean can't ignore
what is going on, and eventually ends their relationship. Rory and Jess immediately become a couple. Meanwhile, she and Paris
spend the year as Student Body Presidents at Chilton and both submit applications to Harvard University. Paris is devastated when
she doesn't get in. Rory is accepted but decides to attend Yale University instead, much to Emily and Richard's delight. The 
Independence Inn is badly damaged in a fire, but Lorelai and Sookie are able to buy the Dragonfly when its elderly owner dies. 
Luke begins dating a lawyer named Nicole. Lane Kim, Rory's best friend, starts a band called Hep Alien and tries to convince her
strict mother to let her date the guitarist, Dave, while keeping the band secret. As the season ends, Jess abruptly leaves Stars
Hollow to track down his estranged father in California, and Rory graduates High School as valedictorian.
