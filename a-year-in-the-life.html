Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life

Nine years after the end of the original series, Rory is struggling in her journalism career and having a no-strings-attached,
secret affair with Logan in London, while technically having a boyfriend named Paul that she often forgets about. While Logan is engaged
to be married the two of them can't seem to stay apart. Lorelai and Luke live together but are still having communication problems.
Richard has recently died of a heart attack, which causes tension between Lorelai and Emily and they end up in joint therapy. Lorelai 
starts to question her life, so travels to California with intentions to hike the Pacific Crest Trail, where she has an epiphany: she 
fixes the rift with Emily by recounting a happy story about Richard, and goes home to propose to Luke. Emily decides to sell the Gilmore
mansion and move to Nantucket, where she starts working in a museum. Rory decides to write a book about her life called "Gilmore Girls".
After Luke and Lorelai marry, Rory tells her mom that she is pregnant and the father is left unknown.
